                <p class="about">
                    I have worked as a computer technician, system administrator, and cybersecurity officer in an organization with over 15 years of experience in IT.
                    Two years ago, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the company faced ongoing business challenges and consecutive financial losses, which necessitated the reduction or layoff of certain positions. A volunteer program was initiated, leading to some positions becoming vacant. During that time, the company assigned me to take on a procurement role to fill the vacancy (without hiring new staff).
                    During this period, when I was assigned a new role, I was ready to accept the change. I made efforts to learn, study, and perform the assigned tasks to the best of my ability. At the same time, I did not abandon my IT experience and expertise. I set goals and made plans to learn IT skills, searched for learning resources, registered for online and in-person courses from reputable and trusted institutions, enrolled in training programs, developed new skills, and continuously focused on self-learning and enhancing my modern IT skills. My learning did not affect my regular work. I always gave myself the opportunity to prepare, which is what I call "transforming into a mutant human."
                    If your company is looking for someone with the same qualifications as mine, and if my qualifications match the requirements of your company, I would be delighted to be part of your team. I am ready to start working immediately if your company considers this opportunity for me. I am prepared to bring my knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience to support your organization, striving to work together and be a part of driving your organization's growth and progress.
                    I am currently working at Bangkok Coil Center Co., Ltd. in Pathum Thani, Thailand.
                    I hold the following IT skills certifications:
                    -Data Science and Machine Learning with Python from IT_KMTL
                    -Data Analysis Bootcamp (DAB#8) from Skooldio
                    -Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB#2) from Skooldio               
                </p>
